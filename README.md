# Banking-Data-Integration-Snowflake
End-to-end data integration project using IBM DataStage and Snowflake. Demonstrates loading enterprise data from Db2 Warehouse to Snowflake.

## üìù Project Overview
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data integration process** by building a **DataStage flow** that extracts enterprise data from **Db2 Warehouse**, transforms it, and loads it into a **Snowflake data warehouse**. The objective was to showcase the use of **IBM DataStage** for creating robust data pipelines using modern cloud technologies.

## üß™ Outcomes

By completing this project, we demonstrated:

- An understanding of **modern data pipelines**.
- Practical knowledge of **Snowflake** and **IBM DataStage**.
- The ability to **automate data ingestion and transformation workflows** in a cloud environment.

---

## üìö Conclusion

- This project demonstrated how to create an **end-to-end data integration pipeline** using **IBM DataStage** and **Snowflake**. By completing this project, we successfully loaded enterprise banking data from **Db2 Warehouse** into **Snowflake**, applying transformations along the way. This workflow showcases the power of **cloud-native ETL tools** to handle large volumes of data efficiently.

- The skills gained from this project‚Äîsuch as **setting up data connections**, **handling schema drift**, and **performing data transformations**‚Äîare highly valuable for building **scalable, modern data pipelines** in cloud environments.

- We encourage further exploration of **Snowflake's advanced capabilities** and **IBM DataStage's pre-built transformations** to build more complex data flows.
